	# This is the only thing you should have to change.
	# 	Where are the installation files located,
	# 	or to where do you want them downloaded?
	# 	(The script will attempt to create this
	# 	folder if it does not already exist.)

#
#		A Note For Convenience
#
#
#	If you want to be able to run this script without needing to enter
#	your administrator (sudo) password multiple times, I recommend adding
#	this line to /etc/sudoers:
#
#		%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/installer
#
# 	Alternatively you can call this script under 'sudo' but that's risky
# 	for reasons you ought to understand before doing it. (Notably: if I
# 	made any mistakes here and they're running as 'sudo' they might be
# 	able to (unintentionally) do a lot more damage



####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####|####
#
#
#	You should not _have_ to change anything below here.
#
#	You are, of course, encouraged to look and see what I'm doing, and why
#	(which should be explained in the comments).
